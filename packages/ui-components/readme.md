Bundle that allows the composition of UI node trees using [JSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html).

Note: Although JSX is used, not many similarities are shared with React. It's design philosophy
is more closely related to Angular.

## Setup

Add the following settings to your `tsconfig.json`: 

```json
{
  "jsx": "react-jsx",
  "jsxImportSource": "@heliks/tiles-ui-components/lib"
}
```
